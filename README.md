I really enjoyed doing this test, the design is beautiful.
When i first looked at the website i divided it into sections and thought about how i would approach 
each section and which tools I will use. Responsivness was a little bit tricky, but I also solved it without too much difficulty, I hope you like it.
The section in which the images moved horizontally also required little thought.

It took me three days with 3-4 hours each day to complete this challenge.

note: If you are resizing browser, please reload the page to restart the variables and make all the animations work properly.
